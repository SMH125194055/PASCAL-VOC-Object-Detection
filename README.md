# PASCAL VOC 2007 Object Detection and Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a **multi-label classification** and **object detection** system using the **PASCAL VOC 2007** dataset. The model is built using **transfer learning** with **MobileNetV2** as a feature extractor and follows a **multi-task learning** paradigm to predict both bounding boxes and class labels simultaneously.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Multi-task Learning**: Joint object localization (bounding box regression) and classification.
- **Data Augmentation**: Extensive image augmentations to improve model generalization.
- **Transfer Learning**: MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet used as a fixed feature extractor.
- **Focal Loss**: Addresses class imbalance effectively.
- **Image Processing**: Smart padding and resizing while maintaining aspect ratio.
